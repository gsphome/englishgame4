# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |

| 1.x.x   | ❌ No              |

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization
- **HTML Sanitization**: All user-generated HTML content is sanitized using our custom `htmlSanitizer.ts` utility
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated using Zod schemas and custom validation functions
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented to prevent abuse of user actions

### 2. Secure HTTP Communications
- **TLS Validation**: All HTTP requests use secure fetch utilities with TLS validation
- **URL Validation**: URLs are validated to prevent SSRF attacks
- **Request Headers**: Security headers are automatically added to all requests

### 3. Security Headers
The application implements comprehensive security headers:
- `Content-Security-Policy`: Prevents XSS and code injection
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`: Prevents clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`: Enables XSS filtering
- `Referrer-Policy`: Controls referrer information
- `Permissions-Policy`: Restricts browser features

### 4. Secure Logging
- **Production Logging**: Console logs are disabled in production
- **Sensitive Data Filtering**: Logs automatically filter sensitive information
- **Structured Logging**: Secure logging utility prevents information leakage

### 5. Dependency Security
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are regularly updated to latest secure versions
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- **License Compliance**: All dependencies use approved licenses

### 6. Build Security
- **Source Maps**: Disabled in production builds
- **Code Minification**: Terser minification with security optimizations
- **Bundle Analysis**: Regular analysis of bundle contents

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should not be disclosed publicly until they have been addressed.

### 2. Report privately
Send an email to: [security@yourcompany.com] with:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues within 7 days, others within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users have had time to update

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Review Requirements
- All code changes must be reviewed by at least one maintainer
- Security-sensitive changes require review by security team
- Automated security checks must pass

### Secure Coding Guidelines
1. **Never hardcode secrets** - Use environment variables
2. **Validate all inputs** - Use Zod schemas and validation utilities
3. **Sanitize HTML content** - Use provided sanitization utilities
4. **Use secure HTTP utilities** - Don't use raw fetch() for external requests
5. **Follow logging guidelines** - Use secure logger, avoid sensitive data

### Testing Security
- Write security tests for new features
- Test input validation thoroughly
- Verify XSS prevention measures
- Check for information leakage

## Security Tools and Automation

### CI/CD Security Checks
- **Dependency Audit**: `npm audit` runs on every build
- **Code Analysis**: CodeQL security scanning
- **Secret Scanning**: TruffleHog for detecting secrets
- **License Checking**: Automated license compliance verification

### Development Tools
- **ESLint Security Rules**: Configured to catch security issues
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled for type safety
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting

### Monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Secure error reporting (no sensitive data)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Application performance tracking
- **Security Headers**: Automated verification of security headers

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
Never commit sensitive data. Use environment variables for:
- API keys
- Database credentials
- Third-party service tokens
- Encryption keys

### Content Security Policy
Current CSP configuration:
```
default-src 'self';
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
img-src 'self' data: https:;
font-src 'self';
connect-src 'self';
frame-ancestors 'none';
```

### Permissions Policy
Restricted browser features:
- Geolocation: Disabled
- Microphone: Disabled  
- Camera: Disabled
- Payment: Disabled
- USB: Disabled

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Breach
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Assess the scope and impact
   - Contain the breach
   - Preserve evidence

2. **Communication**
   - Notify security team immediately
   - Prepare user communication
   - Coordinate with legal team if needed

3. **Recovery**
   - Deploy security fixes
   - Monitor for additional threats
   - Update security measures

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct security review
   - Update security procedures
   - Document lessons learned
